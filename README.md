# Tamina-ML-Tg-project


This repository contains code for predicting the glass transition temperature (Tg) of polymers using machine learning techniques. The model utilizes Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFP) for feature representation and implements various regression algorithms, including LightGBM, XGBoost, and Random Forest.

We utilized the dataset from https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-023-01088-3, but instead of the OPSIN data used in the reference, we generated canonical SMILES and ECFP4 fingerprints for the polymers to enhance our analysis.
